kagoiri-musume : A simple dummy application of Kahua

[Requirements]

Gauche-0.8.5
Kahua-0.3.4

[Installation]

  % autoconf
  % ./configure [any options if you need]

You may modify to fit for your environment about DB setting.
Which modify point is in the file kagoiri-musume/user-setting.kahua.

  % vi kagoiri-musume/user-setting.kahua

NOTE: If you change *kagoiri-musume-database-name* to mysql or pgsql,
      You setting up these database and create database.

You have to give some options to specify the same install directories 
as Kahua installed. For example if you gave --prefix=$HOME to 
configure script of Kahua when you installed it, you have to give the 
same option to kahua-web's configure script.

  % ./configure --prefix=$HOME

And then

  % make
  % make check
  % make dbinit
  % make install

NOTE: When you do 'make dbinit', initialize Database.
      But, at current version, this correctly work for only fsdb.
      I mean 'correctly work' equal 'delete database, create database and insert
      initial parameters.
      If you never do 'make dbinit', then you NEED to 'make dbinit'.
      Because, administrater's user account is created by this.

Then, edit app-servers in the Kahua working directory to add "kagoiri-musume" entry.

  (kagoiri-musume :argument () :run-by-default 0)

If you want to allow non registered user to edit page, 
give 'non-member-edit as a argument.

  (kagoiri-musume :argument (non-member-edit) :run-by-default 0)

[Task at First Contact]
At first conntact for Kagoiri-Musume, you can login by only 'kago' account.
The 'kago' account is system administrater level account.
And then, you enter to system administrater's page with this account.
The kago account's user name is 'kago' and password is 'kago'.
Next, you change kago's password, and add normal user's.
After that, you enjoy to play with Kagoiri-Musume.

[Invoke kagoiri-musume in place]

You can invoke the kagoiri-musume before doing "make install", using
"kagoiri-musume-start" script.  This script invoke kagoiri-musume in the kahua-spvr
