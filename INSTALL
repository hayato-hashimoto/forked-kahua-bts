as Kahua installed. For example if you gave --prefix=$HOME to 
configure script of Kahua when you installed it, you have to give the 
same option to kahua-web's configure script.

  % ./configure --prefix=$HOME

Then, edit app-servers in the Kahua working directory to add "kagoiri-musume" entry.

  (kagoiri-musume :argument () :run-by-default 0)

If you want to allow non registered user to edit page, 
give 'non-member-edit as a argument.

  (kagoiri-musume :argument (non-member-edit) :run-by-default 0)
